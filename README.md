# LagrangeView: A 3D Visualization of the James-Webb Space Telescope Orbit

**LagrangeView** is an educational and interactive 3D representation of the James-Webb Space Telescope's orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2) of the Earth-Sun system. This project is developed using the powerful WebGL library, Three.js, along with Blender for 3D modeling, bringing to life the celestial mechanics that keep the JWST in a stable position to observe the universe.

## Features

- **3D Scene Creation**: A static 3D scene that accurately represents the Earth-Sun system, the Earth's orbit, the five Lagrange points, and the JWST's orbit around L2, complemented with randomly placed stars for cosmic ambiance.
- **Texture Animation**: Using Krita and Three.js, this feature allows the simulation of Earth's rotation and the seamless movement of the JWST along its orbit.
- **Satellite Modeling**: The JWST is modeled with high fidelity in Blender, using primitive shapes and smooth shading to reflect its intricate design and functionality.
- **Scene Animation**: Animations that bring the JWST's orbit to life, demonstrating the satellite's rotation and revolution in the context of the larger celestial ballet of the Earth-Sun system.

## Technical Highlights

- **Three.js**: Enables the creation of 3D graphics right in the browser, offering an immersive educational experience without the need for specialized software.
- **Blender**: Used for detailed modeling of the JWST and texturing the celestial bodies within the scene.
- **Krita**: Assists in creating high-quality textures to represent planetary surfaces and other celestial features.

This project showcases the potential of combining modern web technologies with the principles of astronomy and 3D graphics to create an interactive learning tool. Whether you're a student, educator, or space enthusiast, **LagrangeView** offers a window into the mechanics of space through the lens of the James-Webb Space Telescope's journey.
